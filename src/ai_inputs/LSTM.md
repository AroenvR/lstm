# What the code does:
The code imports the axios library and defines a function "httpGet" that uses axios to make a GET request to the specified url. It returns the server's response data if the status is 200, and logs error details if there is an error. Another function "getBtcData" is defined which makes a GET request to the CoinGecko API for Bitcoin OHLC data. It maps the response data to an array of objects that conform to the IOHLCData interface, and returns the array. The code also uses Tensorflow library to define and train a stacked LSTM model to predict bitcoin data. It preprocesses the data by using the last 31 days as target values and the rest as input values, and trains the model for 10 epochs.
